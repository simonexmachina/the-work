# Cursor Configuration

## Test Configuration

When running tests via Cursor's agent, Vitest watch mode is automatically disabled to prevent waiting for changes when tests fail. This is configured in `vitest.config.js` and is triggered when:

- Running in CI environment (`CI` env var is set)
- Running via Cursor agent (`CURSOR_AGENT` env var is set)
- Running in non-interactive mode (no TTY)

This ensures tests complete immediately rather than waiting for file changes when running in automated contexts.
