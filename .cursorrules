# Cursor Configuration

## Development Server

To start the development server for this project, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start an http-server on port 8080 and automatically open the application in your browser.

## Test Configuration

When running tests via Cursor's agent, Vitest watch mode is automatically disabled to prevent waiting for changes when tests fail. This is configured in `vitest.config.js` and is triggered when:

- Running in CI environment (`CI` env var is set)
- Running via Cursor agent (`CURSOR_AGENT` env var is set)
- Running in non-interactive mode (no TTY)

This ensures tests complete immediately rather than waiting for file changes when running in automated contexts.

## Version Control

Create Git commits frequently.
